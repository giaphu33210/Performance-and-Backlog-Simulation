# Performance-and-Backlog-Simulation
A Google Sheets tool to simulate delivery performance and backlog risk under different volume and SLA conditions.

## 📌 Objective
To anticipate operational risks and assess buffer capacity by simulating daily delivery volume vs capacity and backlog accumulation.

## ⚙️ Features
- Simulation model for backlog buildup and clearance
- Backlog health status categorization (Good / Warning / Critical)
- KPI sensitivity testing: what-if analysis with varying SLA & volume

## 🚀 How It Works
- Users input average daily volume, SLA, and clearance rate.
- Script projects backlog over time and highlights risk levels.
- Charts visualize backlog growth and recovery scenarios.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Google Sheets
- Google Apps Script
